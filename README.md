# RESYNCHRONIZE

Simple library/bunch of functionalities to fetch/promise async element and put a meaninful state for your appplication

*It's in absolutly alpha*

## Requirements
`redux` Where you store the magical/not-as-magical-as-you-though async nodes
`redux-thunk` Your redux state need some way to dispatch actions from.. another dispatch :surprise:
`react-redux` I will probably just remove it from here but its required to use the functionalties with react :shrug:
